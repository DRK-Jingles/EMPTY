### Does your log mention database corruption?

If your log reports panics because of database corruption it is
most likely a fault with your system's storage or memory. You will need to
delete the index database to clear this.

### Include required information

Please be sure to include at least:

 - which version of browser and what operating system you are using
 - browser and version, if applicable
 - what happened,
 - what you expected to happen instead, and
 - any steps to reproduce the problem.
